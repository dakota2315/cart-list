# FinalProject

This project use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, Maven, SpringBoot to create a front-end and a back-end for a program
"List of To Buy"

I used Oracle Netbeans 11.3, Visual Studio Code 1.44, Postman 7.23, GIMP 2.10.18 on Windows and Linux Ubuntu
the resulting program was uploaded to the Amazon S3 and EC2 AWS.

The program let the user to create a list of things to buy the next time they go to the supermarket or any other store. 
The user can create and delete items; the items are saved to a DataFile for use anytime 
even if the server goes out of service for any reason.
